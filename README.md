**Worst Earthquakes** is an android application to view the worst earthquakes in recent history

This allows the display of earthquakes with a reading of higher than 8.0 on the richter scale.

Time spent on Day 1 getting mocked data displaying: **2** hours
Time spent on Day 2 getting http requests and further formatting, sorting: **4**  hours

The following functionality is completed:

* [x] Display earthquakes in a list view
* [x] Distinguish between major earthquakes (>= 8)
* [x] Swipe down to refresh data -- although hopefully earthquakes won't happen that frequently
* [x] http requests to pull live data
* [x] Remove formatted=true as it can save nearly 0.5Kb (down from 2Kb to 1.5Kb)
* [x] Sorting by date rather than by magnitude
* [ ] Display small MapView
* [ ] Geolocation
* [ ] Draggable map to look up other areas
